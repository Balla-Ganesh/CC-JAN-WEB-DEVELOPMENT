# CC-JAN-WEB-DEVELOPMENT
 I have successfully completed 2 projects and 1 golden project allocated to me

Project 1: JavaScript Quiz Game

In this project i have built a quizz web application using JavaScript.
In JavaScript i have pre-defined all the questions and their options and correct answer.
Now using the document queries i have changed the questions and respective options. When user selects the answer and click submit then the selected option is matched with the correct answer stored in the JavaScript and increments the score accordingly.
I have made changes to the frontend like updating questions score and all using document queries.

Hosting: It can be simply run on local maching using live server from vs code.


Project 2: Notes App

This is a dynamic application which is used to create notes of the things. We can also view, edit and delete them.
I build this using ExpressJs, MongoDB and Bootstrap. 
I created a schema for a model in my database that has name and description. I pushed all the new created notes to my database and user can access them anytime and user can edit or delete them.

Hosting: It can be deployed on local machine using the below command
npm run devstart
Visit "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser.


Project 3: Quizz App with Admin Panel

This is a dynamic web application built using ExpressJs and MongoDB. In this i created a admin login and on success login he has access to a new page called "Admin" where he can add new quizz questions. All these questions are pushed to the database and when a user wnts to take a quizz these are retrived from database.

It is still in working as the validating of the answer is not yet coded so score updation is not available. A part fro this the Admin page pushing questions to database and retriving them are completed

Hosting: It can be deployed on local machine using the below command
npm run devstart
Visit "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser.
